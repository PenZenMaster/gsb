**🧠 RankRocket Project Log — April 6, 2025**

---

### ✅ Current Status
- **Frontend**: Vite + React UI launched at `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend**: Node.js API server running at `http://localhost:3001`
- **UI Functionality**:
  - App loads but styling is minimal or broken (Tailwind or component issues)
  - Control panel fails to fetch accounts (`/accounts` endpoint not reachable or backend not responding)

---

### 📦 Today’s Progress (April 6, 2025)
**Time Estimate: ~6 hours total**

#### Frontend:
- ✅ Vite + React project scaffolded with TailwindCSS
- ✅ Tailwind patch + PostCSS config fixed
- ✅ Component import issues resolved
- ✅ UI Kit ZIP created and deployed
- ✅ Dashboard.jsx patched with working relative paths
- ✅ Alias config added (and noted for future)

#### Backend:
- ✅ Confirmed API server (`server.js`) functional
- ⚠️ Backend not responding to `/accounts` (likely missing `accounts.json` or endpoint logic bug)

#### Utility:
- ✅ ZIP extraction auto-installer
- ✅ Full UI Kit bundle
- ✅ `launch-all.bat` created to auto-run frontend and backend

---

### 🚧 Outstanding Issues
- [ ] UI is missing styling polish (likely due to mislinked or misused Tailwind classes)
- [ ] Backend `/accounts` endpoint is failing (likely due to missing or misread accounts file)
- [ ] No error reporting in UI for network failures (future improvement)

---

### 🧭 Next Jump Plan
1. **Fix backend `/accounts`**
   - Verify existence of `storage/accounts.json`
   - Validate route logic in `server.js`
   - Add fallback if file is missing

2. **Style the UI**
   - Confirm Tailwind classes are applied
   - Verify layout components (Card, Button, Input) render properly

3. **Add error messaging to frontend**
   - Provide clear visual when backend fails

4. **Prep for Google Site Builder triggers**
   - Add UI state loader
   - Wire GPT + Site Build buttons to display real response
