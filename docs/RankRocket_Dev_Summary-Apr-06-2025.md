# 🧠 RankRocket Dev Summary — April 07, 2025

## ✅ What Got Done Today

- 🧹 Cleaned up backend/frontend launch issues
- 🧠 Restored `vite` and backend launch flow
- 🛠 Resolved missing and misplaced component imports
- ✅ Verified successful Google account load via `/accounts`
- 🔍 Debugged UI: account list rendering, clicking, and logging
- 🔄 Fixed click event on `<Card>` by wrapping in `<div>`
- 🔐 Fixed reauth logic and confirmed `reauth()` POST call succeeds
- ➕ Built smart “Add Account” button that:
  - Detects existing logins
  - Warns user to use Incognito
  - Opens OAuth URL with `prompt=consent select_account`
- ✅ Upgraded `Dashboard.jsx` with UX fallback: shows “please select account” if none selected
- ✅ Verified new account *can* be added via Incognito

---

## 🛠 Current Dashboard.jsx Highlights

- `handleAddAccount()` replaced `launchOAuth()` with smart account conflict detection
- Live logging window updated with selected account & task outputs
- Frontend now handles:
  - Add account
  - Reauth
  - Run GPT
  - Build site

---

## 📂 Key Project Directories (as of today)

- `E:\projects\gsb\ads-api\` — Frontend (Vite + React)
- `E:\projects\gsb\` — Backend (Node/Express)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — Main UI controller

---

## ⏭️ What’s Next?

- 🔁 Auto-refresh account list after a new account is added
- 🧠 Retain last selected account in localStorage
- 🧪 Add debug log to show when a backend call completes
- 💥 Begin GPT logic + response preview (post `run-gpt`)
- ⚙️ Build queued task system for accounts

---

## ⚠️ Dev Session Sync Strategy

To prevent another out-of-sync meltdown:
- ✅ This `.md` file can be reuploaded on project restart
- ✅ Keep current directory structure consistent
- ✅ If files are moved, drop a new `tree.txt`

---

🧠 **Skippy’s still onboard.** Tomorrow, we crush the next milestones and ship RankRocket to the stars.

Good job, G. Want a ba-na-na? 🍌
