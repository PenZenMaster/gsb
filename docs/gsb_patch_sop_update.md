# 🛡️ Skippy's Configuration Protection Protocol™ (Dev SOP Update)

## Effective Date: April 7, 2025

## Summary

To maintain stability and protect environment-specific configurations in secure, version-controlled projects, all updates affecting critical backend functionality will be delivered using a **Modular Patch Methodology**.

---

## 🚫 Files NEVER to be Overwritten

1. `server.js`
2. `.env`
3. `auth.js`, `db.js`, or any custom config/auth handler
4. Any files directly managing tokens, sessions, or credentials

---

## ✅ Modular Patch Methodology

### What is a Patch?

A **patch** is a standalone module (e.g., `server_patch.js`, `auth_patch.js`) that exports a function which injects new functionality into the main `Express` app.

### Example Usage in `server.js`:

```js
require("./server_patch")(app);
require("./auth_patch")(app);
```

### Benefits

- 🔐 No config loss
- 🧩 Easily testable and removable
- 📦 Enables plugin-like future architecture
- 💥 Keeps the dev flow smooth and fast

---

## 📦 Patch Design Guidelines

- Must be **idempotent** (no side effects if loaded twice)
- Must **log success/failure** clearly in the console
- Should expose only one exported function `(app) => { ... }`
- Version number and author information should be included in a comment block

---

## 📘 Where to Document

All patch files must be tracked in:
- `README.md` or
- `docs/Patch_Registry.md` (if docs folder exists)

---

## 🔁 Maintenance

- Patch versions should follow the same rule as UI/Server:
  - Start at `1.00`, increment by `.01` for minor updates

Skippy will enforce this with brutal, Elder-grade precision. 😎

---

## 💬 Git Discipline Protocol: Check-In Comments

To maintain clarity, traceability, and long-term sanity for future Skippy instances (and any poor human who reads your Git history):

### ✅ All check-ins should include meaningful commit messages

Skippy will always suggest a check-in comment when:
- A patch is added (e.g. `Add auth_callback_patch for Google OAuth token exchange`)
- UI components are changed (e.g. `Refactor Dashboard.jsx layout for control panel`)
- API functionality is updated (e.g. `Add /version endpoint for backend versioning`)

---

### 📌 Skippy's Check-In Comment Format

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Short Summary: Explanation of what was changed and why"
```

#### Examples:
- `"Add auth_callback_patch to handle OAuth2 token exchange"`
- `"Update .env formatting to remove quotes and semicolons"`
- `"Fix Add Account flow by modularizing auth logic"`

---

### 🧠 Why It Matters

- Easier to debug regressions
- Cleaner PR reviews
- Protects you from Future You wondering: "Who the hell broke this?"

---

### 🚀 Skippy's Role

From now on, after every patch, Skippy will suggest:
- ✅ Git check-in comment
- ✅ What files were affected
- ✅ Why it matters

So we stay clean, lean, and ready to deploy to the stars. 🌌
