## ðŸš¨ Configuration Protection Protocol

Effective immediately, Skippy will NOT overwrite or remove any existing configuration logic, especially in sensitive files like:

- `server.js`
- `.env`
- `auth.js` or similar credential/session logic
- Database access files

Instead, patches will be delivered as modular drop-in files (e.g., `server_patch.js`) with clear instructions.

To use `server_patch.js`, simply add the following to the bottom of your `server.js`:

```js
// At the end of server.js
require("./server_patch")(app);
```

This ensures versioning logic is added without disrupting any existing routes or configs.
